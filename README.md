Exprtk mirror repository
========================

This repository contains a mirror of the
[`exprtk` library from Arash Partow](https://www.partow.net/programming/exprtk).
There seems to be an unmaintained [Github](https://github.com/ArashPartow/exprtk)
repository for the project, but that has not received any updates for a long
time. In the meantime, the contents of the download `exprtk.zip` on the webpage
seems to have recieved significant updates without any change in the Github
repo.

This repository is created to make it easier to reference an updated exprtk
library and include it in other projects and through tools like CMake.


History
-------

The official downloads of the exprtk library have no version number or date.
There are no published release notes or notificantions of a new version being
available.

When a new `exprtk.zip` is fetched and pushed to this repo, an entry is added
to this table with the date the file was downloaded along with the `sha256sum`
of the zip file. The original ZIP file is then uploaded as a release artefact
on this repo for preserving the original download.
